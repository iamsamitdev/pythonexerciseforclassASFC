        <p>The United States, United Kingdom, Ukraine and several European Union member states have fiercely opposed the pipeline ever since it was first announced in 2015, warning the project would boost Moscow's influence in Europe.

        Kristine Berzina, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a nonpartisan research center, said Moscow has benefited from the drama around the pipeline. "Everything about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been a victory for Russia," she told CNN.

        <p>Elon Musk's holdings of Tesla stock have lost about $30 billion this year through Monday's close, as the stock slid 12%.But the next 12 months could be the most lucrative ever for Musk. If analysts are correct, Tesla will report strong financial results this year that will net Musk billions of dollars in stock awards.

        Musk doesn't receive any base salary or cash bonus from Tesla. Instead, he receives stock options based on the company hitting certain financial and market value targets. His 2018 pay package allocated 101 million split-adjusted shares that would be awarded to Musk in 12 equal tranches, as the company hit those benchmarks.

        Dedicated to the women who gave their lives in their fight for freedom under fascism, it consists of a bronze statue of a murdered partisan, half in the water, half on a platform of bronze and concrete. Placed near the gardens of the Biennale, it is one of relatively few statues dedicated to women in Italy.

        <p>Munn, the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, and Asian-American beauty brand Cocokind had gathered to discuss efforts to stop discrimination against the AAPI community. They wrote about the incident on their respective Instagram accounts.

        While it disrupted our conversation, we later resumed because these malicious acts will not stop the conversation," both Cocokind and the NAPWF wrote. "We started our event with beautifully-spirited and powerful members of the AAPI community talking about our experiences and using our voices, and we will continue..
